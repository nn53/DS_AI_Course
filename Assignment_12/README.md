## **Assignment 12 – Industry Application of Credit Card Fraud Detection**

### 📚 Objective

* Understand how AI and ML are applied in real-world industries.
* Connect your credit card fraud detection project to **practical applications in finance and banking**.

---

### 🔹 Steps Taken

1. **Research Case Studies**

   * AI in **banking and finance** is widely used for fraud detection, credit risk scoring, and anomaly detection.
   * Real-world fraud detection systems monitor transactions in **real time** using machine learning and deep learning models.
   * Examples include:

     * **Visa / Mastercard fraud monitoring**
     * **PayPal anomaly detection**
     * **Banks using AI to flag suspicious transactions**

2. **Connect Project to Industry**

   * Your project replicates a **real-world fraud detection pipeline**:

     1. **Data preprocessing** – cleaning and scaling transaction data
     2. **ML / ANN models** – detect fraudulent transactions
     3. **Evaluation** – ROC-AUC and confusion matrix to quantify performance
   * This is exactly how financial institutions train fraud detection models on historical data.

3. **Insights & Benefits**

   * Reduces financial loss due to fraudulent transactions.
   * Improves customer trust and safety.
   * Provides a foundation for deploying **real-time fraud detection systems**.
