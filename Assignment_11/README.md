🟢 Assignment 11: NLP Preprocessing – Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📚 Objective
* Apply NLP preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF if dataset contains text.
* For our project, dataset is tabular and contains no text features.

---

## 🔹 Steps Taken
* Reviewed dataset – no textual features present.
* Documented that NLP preprocessing is not applicable.
* Ensured tabular preprocessing (scaling, encoding) is complete for ML/ANN models.

---

## 📊 Project Milestone
* NLP pipeline ready for text projects.
* For tabular data, ML/ANN preprocessing pipeline is fully operational.
